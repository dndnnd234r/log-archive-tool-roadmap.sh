# Log Archive Tool
A beginner project made by roadmap.sh based on one of the projects from the Linux Roadmap

Inside the file there are step-by-step explanations on how each part works

The basic command prompt to archive a directory is ./log_archive [log-directory]

I'm new to coding, so if there are any mistakes, please tell me!

Here's the project from roadmap.sh: https://roadmap.sh/projects/log-archive-tool
